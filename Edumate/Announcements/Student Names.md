# Student names, preferred names and legal names

Due to government reporting and schools issuing 'official documents' ie Academic School reports, it is necessary for the school to record the legal name of the student (as it appears on a birth certificate, passport or other identification documentation).

In some cases students have preferred names.  There will be preferred firstnames (ie my son is known as 'Zach' despite being 'Zachary' on his birth certificate) and sometimes in the cases of guardianship/carer arrangements there may be preferred surnames.  In recent months, there seems to be a rise in the need for a preferred surname field.

At present, we do not have a preferred surname field.  While a request has been made to Edumate, we are aware that there is need to be able to accommodate this request in the interim.

## Recording preferred name vs legal name

In setting up students, this is how we would like all colleges to manage 'preferred names' based on the name fields as follows in Edumate:
- Firstname - always to be the legal first name of the student as per official documentation ie birth certificates, passports, etc.
- Other name - legal middle name(s) of the student as per documentation.
- Surname - legal surname of the student as per documentation.
- Preferred Name field as follows:
	+ Preferred firstname - enter in the 'preferred name' field the preferred firstname of the student ie 'Zach'. 
	+ Preferred surname - enter in the 'preferred name' field the preferred fullname of the student ie 'Surname, Zach'.

If we consistently enter data in the same way, many of our reports can be adjusted in order to accommodate using a student's preferred name, rather than their legal name for internal, communicaton and informal purposes.

## Print templates

Please note that where your College uses 'print templates' loaded to a print button, we will not be able to accommodate the use of the preferred name as well as we are able via module and correspondence reports.  In the case of print templates, you can edit these to use the command 'preferred_name' and data will populate as follows:
- Zachary (Zach) Dawson - firstname is preferred.
- Zachary (Surname, Zach) Dawson - where surname is preferred.

For both print templates and 'on screen' reading of names, it will be a matter of educating your College staff to use the bracketed names in order to accommodate preferred name requests.

## Updating Module / Correspondence reports to accommodate use of preferred names

As reports are open to fulfill identified modifications of staff, edits will be made to use our new preferred name approach.  

Where you identify a report that requires updating, please send through a sample of the report, that includes a child who has a preferred name.  Edits will be then made and tested on this basis.

Please note that edits have already been made to Weekly Summaries.

As we have greater flexibility over these types of reports, using the example above, the student's name on these types of reports will be displayed as 'Zach Surname'.

## Parent Requests of preferred surname

If you do receive requests of a 'preferred surname', please inform the family that official documentation will still contain the legal name of the student.  Please also advise, that while every effort will be made to use the student's preferred surname for unofficial documentation, sometimes it may still contain the legal name.

## Report updates

Please remember we have a new ticketing system for Edumate support, and you can submit report update requests to edumate-support@yourschool.state.edu.au ie edumate-support@groves.qld.edu.au.

## Data Integrity Check

A data integrity check can be performed at any time, based on entries in the 'preferred name' field of Edumate, by running the following report, that will look at all current students by going to *Enrolment Reports > Module > Data Integrity / Clean Up > Preferred Name Data Integrity Check*.
