# Edumate > Edval sync for confirmed new enrolments in advance

Did you know, that you can allocate student classes in Edval, well in advance for confirmed new students?  After completing a students form enrolments, regardless of the timeframe until their start date, here is a short video to demonstrate how to add new students into your Edval file from Edumate in advance, allocate their classes and then publish class lists according to the new students start dates from Edval to Edumate.

This means that those class allocations, elective line choices and any other interview discussions around class enrolments can all be set in advance once enrolment is confirmed by the enrolment contract.

This also means that if you are projecting form run enrolments, or class number enrolments, that these future students will be included in the data set, based on their enrolment dates for their form runs and classes.  ie a new students start next term, and you have already allocated them to forms and classes, if you run any reports based on next term's start date, the numbers will be accurate as per the data you have entered and managed via both Edumate and Edval.
