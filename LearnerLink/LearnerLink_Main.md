Here is where you find information about Learner.Link. Below are some links.

Designed specifically for K-12 teachers and students, Canvas is an easy-to-use, cloud-based learning management system (LMS) that connects all the digital tools and resources teachers use in one simple place.

Canvas allows you to:
- Conduct online, asynchronous discussions with your students.
- Provide feedback and post grades for assignments.
- Upload documents, videos, audio files, and more.
- Post deadlines and reminders through the calendar and announcements.
- Manage group work assignments.
- Connect via video conference with individual students, a whole class, or guest speakers.

## Accessing Canvas

Staff can sign in to Canvas using the staff application launcher at [https://staff.ccmschools.app](https://staff.ccmschools.app).

Students can sign in to Canvas using your college's application launcher at https://yourschool.ccmschools.app.

## Setting up a course

Canvas synchronizes courses from Edumate. Staff, students and carers have been loaded into each course ready for use. To make your course available to students all you need to do is create your content and then publish the course. Instructions for this are available in the [Canvas Guides](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-13030-415257126).

It is important to note that each class within a year level/subject shares a single course. Individual classes are enroled into course 'sections' however any content posted is available to any class.

Getting help

The Help icon in the main menu of Canvas is your gateway to accessing the help resources. This includes hundreds of online guides and tutorials.

If your support issue is regarding user course enrolments, you should direct your request to help@learner.link.

## Are you new to using an LMS?

Just like adopting any other technology, using an LMS in your classroom generally requires you to change or modify your current pedagogical practices and teaching styles. This can be a daunting prospect for many people. SAMR is a model designed to help teachers incorporate technology into their teaching and learning. Developed by Dr. Ruben Puentedura, the model supports and enables teachers to design, develop, and infuse digital learning experiences that utilise technology. Whilst the model is focused on achieving higher order thinking, it also serves as a great set of stepping stones. Set yourself a goal to substitute and you will naturally find yourself moving towards augmentation, modification and redefinition over time.
