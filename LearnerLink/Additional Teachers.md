# Additional teachers & user permission levels in Learner.Link

## Course level privileges

The following roles are automatically assigned based on Edumate class membership data:
1. **Teacher** - The teacher role grants a user permission to publish course content; upload resources; create assignments, discussions and quizzes and enter grades & feedback for student assessment.
2. **Student** - Students can access and interact with course materials as well as submit assessment. 
3. **Observer** - This user role is linked to a student enrolled in a course. All parents and carers with the 'Reports' flag in Edumate are assigned this role to view their student's course progress. 

In addition, teachers may request additional staff to be added to a course in the following roles. The college's timetable administrator will need to add these via the class teacher assignment in Edumate.
1. **Teacher Aide** (Teacher Aide in Edumate)<br>
A teacher aide has identical access to a teacher with the following exceptions:
	a. Can not publish a course
	b. Can not edit learning outcomes
2. **Course Designer** (other in Edumate)<br>
	A course designer has identical access to a teacher with the following exceptions:
	a. Can not edit grades
	b. Can not moderate discussions

>Note: Where there is more than one class (known as a section in Canvas) in a course, a Teacher or Teacher Aide's view will be filtered to only show their section(s) based on which classes they are assigned to in Edumate.

## School-level privileges

There are two additional user permission levels that staff can be granted in Canvas that apply across the whole College. Principals must submit a request in writing help@learner.link for staff to be assigned these permissions.
1. **Course View All** - Users with this access level may view and browse all courses in your college sub-account.
2. **Course Design All** - Users with this access level may act as a course designer in all courses in your College sub-account.

## Department level privileges

School level privileges are also granted on departmental basis. Departments will reflect the departments that subjects are assigned to in Edumate.

## Synchronisation between Edumate and Learner.Link on Canvas

Changes made to academic hierarchy, teacher assignment and class enrolments will typically be reflected in Edumate within four hours.

Allocation of supply teachers from Daily Org Management will generally occur by 9:00am local time each day.
