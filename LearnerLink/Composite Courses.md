# Setting up composite or combined courses

By default, a course is created for each year level class. If you need to combine your courses because you teach multiple year levels concurrently, please follow these instructions:

Firstly you will need to obtain the URL from the address bar of each course that needs to be merged together.

![Copy the URL from the desired courses](../static/LearnerLink/CompositeCourses.png "URL Example")

Once you have obtained the course URLs select the **:question: Help** icon and then select '[Get Technical Support](https://ccm-learnerlink.paperform.co/)' to submit a request.
