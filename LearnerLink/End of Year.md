# Learner.Link end of year course rollover information (including course deletion)

## What happens to current courses at the end of the year?

Each course in Canvas is linked to an academic year. At the end of the academic year, your current courses will automatically have their status changed from "Current" to "Completed". Providing the course remains published, when a course becomes completed, students can still view and access the course but they can no longer interact with the course by posting assignments or participating in activities such as discussions. You can think of this as the course being archived in read-only mode.

## How long are courses archived for?

- **Unpublished courses** are archived for at least **two years**. This means that unpublished courses from 2019 and earlier are scheduled to be deleted in December 2021.
- **Published courses** are retained for at least **three years**. This means that published courses from 2018 and earlier are scheduled to be deleted in December 2021.

## My course is scheduled for deletion - can I download a copy of the course?

[Yes, please follow these instructions.](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-export-a-Canvas-course/ta-p/785#)

## When will 2022 courses be available to begin populating?

New courses linked to the 2022 academic year will automatically appear in canvas within 6 hours of the college's 2022 timetable being synchronised from Edval into Edumate. The minimum data that must be synchronised is class data and teacher assignments. Please confirm with your college administration staff when they expect the first 2022 timetable synchronisation to occur.

## If a new course is being created for 2022, how do I import content from an earlier year?

All content from the current year can easily be copied into your next course by following [these instructions](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-12935-415257077).
