# Removing Users - Past Staff

## ​​​​​Removing User privileges from Staff in Edumate

For staff who are no longer in employment, you will need to remove their user privileges in Edumate as well as give them an 'end date' so that Edumate can change their status to past.
- Navigate to the staff's contact record.
- Click on the 'group tab'.
- Select the groups on the right hand side of the screen using Ctrl + mouse click (to select multiple groups at once).
- Click remove in the middle of the screen and press save.
- Under the Access Tab, untick 'Active Account' and press SAVE. 

## Giving Staff a 'Past Staff' Status

- Click on the staff tab.
- Locate the end date field and enter appropriate date.
- Under the groub tab, you DO NOT need to uncheck anything.  This retains the historical tab information for your staff.  The end date, and the removal of groups under the groups tab is sufficient.

## General Tab - Email Address 

Please do not store personal 'past staff' members personal email addresses in this field (please record their personal email address in the appropriate field in the staff tab.  This means that any scheduled reports that have been set to go to a 'contact' rather than a 'group' will continue to be sent to the staff member. Not ideal at all!

## Scheduled Reports

Please go through the scheduled reports that you have set up, if there are scheduled reports set to send to 'Contacts' ie you inidividually select staff members, these will need to have the 'past staff members' removed (unticked).  For scheduled reports, it is more ideal to send to a 'group' then as group membership changes, so do the recipients without manual intervention.
